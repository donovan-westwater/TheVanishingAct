This is my foundations of game production project.

Controls:

Movement WASD (PC)

Rewind shot Spell -J: 
Tags an enemy/object. Over the course of the next several seconds, all actions made by the enemy/object are recorded. Then when the secondary activation button is pressed, time is rewound for that object/enemy, smoothly moving it backward through time. 
(Costs 1 mana)

Rewind time -L: Rewinds time for enemy tagged by Rewind Shot

Teleport Grab -F:Teleports an object a limited distance away that is in line of sight of the player into their inventory. The spells are cast in the direction the player is aiming at, about 5 units away. 
(Costs 1 mana)

Spatial Tunnel -Space: Player phases out of reality and into an extra-dimensional hallway. The hallway extends across the entire map in a straight line in the direction of the players facing, and allows the player to move across it unobstructed. This means that the player can go anywhere on the map, even past walls, as long as it is in a straight line from where the player is aiming at. Given that it exists outside of time, Guards are frozen in their tracks while in this state. 
(Costs 3 mana)
